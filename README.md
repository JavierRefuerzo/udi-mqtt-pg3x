This Poly provides an interface between MQTT broker and Polyglot v3 server.

### Installation instructions
You can install the Node Server from the Polyglot store 

### Notes

This BETA version has added a DIMMER module and expanded ANALOG to include A0, Temperature, Illuminance, Range, pH and MQX. "Query" may not work!
It now also allows for multiple sensors on the same device. Each device gets its own node.

Please report any problems on the UDI user forum.

Thanks and good luck.
